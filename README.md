# Balaji Venkatesh

I am a Software Analyst at Hitachi Rail, where I develop software for automated rail projects. 

I am also a part-time MASc student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of [Professor Andrew Boutros](https://andrewboutros.github.io/). My research interests are in FPGA design and computer networks.

Before joining the University of Waterloo, I received my Honours Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, specializing in Computer Engineering.
