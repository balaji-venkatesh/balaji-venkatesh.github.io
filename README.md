Hi there! My name is Balaji Venkatesh.

<img style="margin:auto; display:block; width:18rem; height:15rem; border-radius:8px;" src="/assets/Balaji Venkatesh.jpeg" alt="Photo of Balaji Venkatesh"/>

I work as a Software Analyst at Hitachi Rail, where I develop software for automated rail projects. 

Additionally, I am a part-time Masters in Applied Science (MASc) student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Boutros](https://andrewboutros.github.io/). My research interests are in the intersection of FPGA architecture and machine learning.

Before joining the University of Waterloo, I received my Honours Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Engineering Science from the University of Toronto, specializing in Computer Engineering.
